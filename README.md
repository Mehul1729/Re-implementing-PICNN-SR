# Re-implementing-PICNN-SR
This is an attempt to reimplement Physics Informed CNN for Super Resolution of Low Resolution images where ground truth HR data is sparse and Physics Priors and boundary conditions aid in generating HR simulations of fluids from LR data. Additonal small functionalities like training model on LR data with varying noise levels is also added.
